  # Note Taker

  ## Description

  For this week's assignment I created an application that allows the user to create, save, and delete notes. The application does save the notes even after exiting it, the notes need to be deleted in order to be removed from the database. Express node was used on the backend to save and retrieve the notes which were stored in a JSON file.
