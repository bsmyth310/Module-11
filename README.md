  # Note Taker

  ## Description

  For this week's assignment I created an application that allows the user to create, save, and delete notes. The application does save the notes even after exiting it, the notes need to be deleted in order to be removed from the database. Express node was used on the backend to save and retrieve the notes which were stored in a JSON file.

  ## Installation

  Follow the heroku link or Download the files, run npm i, and use node server.js

  ## Actions Taken
  * Used Express.JS back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
  * Created API routing files to request and send responses from the server. 
  * Created a server file set for the Express back end to handle data parsing and to listen to inputs. 
  * Used Heroku to access the application via a live URL. 
  * Completed the bonus section and added a delete function so the user can delete notes.
